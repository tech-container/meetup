While many good courses are available, ML's mathematical lineage continues to place it outside the range of many working programmers. In this talk, we'll see how the core ideas can be understood relative to what is common knowledge in the programming world, so that programmers not exposed to the field can identify opportunities for applying ML, understand how problems are formulated, ask critical questions and otherwise engage constructively with the field. We'll conclude with some notes on emerging ideas and the road ahead.",

        "descr" : "A conversation between imperative and functional programmer. Through this conversation we will try to change the base nature of programmers and make them think more functionally. Functional thinking can help in creating code that is close to business in contrast to code that is close to the system which imperative programming is about. This way, your code can bend with changes to business easily. Not only does functional thinking help in business friendly design but also helps in designing concurrent/asynchronous programs that can benefit from multiple cores. Functional programs are easy to reason about and test, they speak about WHAT to be done rather than HOW to be done.",

        "descr" : "A deep look into Monads from functional design perspective. Monads are the base design pattern that is followed in all of the statically typed functional languages to eliminate a broad set of common problems that programmers face. Understanding Mondas better, can give good insight on how most of functional languages work. In this talk we will try to understand Monads and the rules associated to it, by looking into existing monads as examples, so that we can create our own Monads to solve our business specific problems using this higher level abstraction technique. Creating our own Monads to our business problems can make better, readable and more reusable code.",
