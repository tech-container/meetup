        "descr" : "The pervasive collection and availability of data has resulted in an increased interest in the field of machine learning to leverage it. While many good courses are available, ML's mathematical lineage continues to place it outside the range of many working programmers. In this talk, we'll see how the core ideas can be understood relative to what is common knowledge in the programming world, so that programmers not exposed to the field can identify opportunities for applying ML, understand how problems are formulated, ask critical questions and otherwise engage constructively with the field. We'll conclude with some notes on emerging ideas and the road ahead. <br /><i>Prerequisites</i>:  Some knowledge of functional programming would help, though not strictly necessary.",
